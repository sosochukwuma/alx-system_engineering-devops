## Shell Expansions is about having your (given) commands printed with the help of the *echo* function on the terminal and is useful for checking what your command is doing in the shell. When a command is entered in the command line, it expands into its output which is displayed..

## Shell Variables is about setting a character string to which we assign a value (the assigned value could be a number, text, filename, device or other type of data) by the shell and is required by the shell in order to function correctly.

A variable is nothing more than a pointer to the actual data and the *shell* enables creating, assigning and deleting variable.
